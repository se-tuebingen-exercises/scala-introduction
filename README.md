This is the introduction to Scala, presented in the lecture.

> The notes use objects for namespacing. In the lecture, we have either directly entered code into the console
> or used methods / functions to experiment with expressions.

## Literature

In general, I can recommend the Scala 3 book:

  <https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/introduction.html>

Since in Info 2, you have learnt Java this guide might be particularly helpful:

  <https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html>

Collection API documentation

  <https://scala-lang.org/api/3.2.0/scala/collection/immutable/List.html>

Short intro into collections:

  <https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/collections-classes.html>

Complexity of collections:
